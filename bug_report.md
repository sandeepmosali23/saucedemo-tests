## Bug #001: Problem User - Product Images Display Incorrectly

### Bug Details
**Bug ID**: BUG-001  
**Title**: Product images broken/incorrect for problem_user account  
**Severity**: High  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Status**: Open  
**Reporter**: QA Team  
**Assignee**: Development Team  

### Description
When logged in as the `problem_user`, product images on the inventory page display incorrectly. Some images show broken image icons, while others display incorrect product images (e.g., a dog image instead of a backpack).

### Environment Information
- **Browser**: All browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- **Operating System**: Windows 10, macOS, Ubuntu
- **Screen Resolution**: 1920x1080, 1280x720
- **User Account**: problem_user

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to https://www.saucedemo.com
2. Enter username: `problem_user`
3. Enter password: `secret_sauce`
4. Click "Login" button
5. Observe the product images on the inventory page

### Expected Result
All product images should display correctly, showing the appropriate product images (backpack, bike light, t-shirt, etc.) as they appear for the standard_user.

### Actual Result
- "Sauce Labs Backpack" shows a dog image instead of a backpack
- "Sauce Labs Bike Light" shows a broken image icon
- Other products may show incorrect or missing images

### Evidence
**Screenshots**:
- `problem_user_broken_images.png` - Shows broken/incorrect images
- `standard_user_correct_images.png` - Shows correct images for comparison

**Browser Console Errors**:
```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)
Error: Image source not found - /static/media/sl-404.168b1921.jpg
```

### Impact Assessment
**Business Impact**: Medium
- Users cannot properly identify products
- May lead to incorrect purchases
- Affects user experience and trust

**Technical Impact**: Low
- No functional system failures
- UI/UX issue only

### Workaround
Use a different user account (standard_user, performance_glitch_user) for testing product functionality.

### Additional Information
This appears to be an intentional behavior for the problem_user account, designed to simulate UI issues for testing purposes. However, it should be documented as expected behavior if intentional.

**Status**: Open  
**Reporter**: QA Team  
**Assignee**: Product Team  

### Description
The application provides 6 different user accounts with varying behaviors, but there's insufficient documentation about what behaviors are intentional versus actual bugs. This creates ambiguity in testing and user expectations.

### Users Analyzed
1. **standard_user**: Normal behavior ✓
2. **locked_out_user**: Access denied (documented) ✓
3. **problem_user**: UI/UX issues (partially documented)
4. **performance_glitch_user**: Performance delays (partially documented)

### Issues Identified
**Documentation Gaps**:
- No clear specification of error_user expected behaviors
- Visual_user styling differences not documented
- Unclear which issues are intentional vs bugs
- Missing user guide for testers

**Consistency Issues**:
- Some users work normally, others have specific issues
- No clear categorization of issue types
- Mixed severity levels across user types

### Recommendations
1. **Create User Behavior Matrix**: Document expected behavior for each user
2. **Categorize Issues**: Separate intentional test scenarios from actual bugs
3. **Update Documentation**: Provide clear guidance for testers
4. **Standardize Naming**: Ensure user names reflect their intended behavior

### Impact Assessment
**Business Impact**: Low
- Affects testing efficiency
- May cause confusion in bug reporting
- Impacts test automation reliability

**Technical Impact**: Medium
- Affects test strategy development
- Influences automation framework design
